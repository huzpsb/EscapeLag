Use of instructions:
The option to select language is provided in the configuration file, but if you modify it to English, you just modify the plug-in command to English.
The prompt information that can be adjusted in the configuration file is still in Chinese.
You can refer to this manual to manually change all the hints to English.

Welcome to the configuration guide!
Thank you for using the EscapeLag plug-in.
The plug-in is a technically-optimized plug-in that integrates optimization, fixing bugs, restricting actions, and high algorithmic efficiency.

Check this guide to configure your Config.yml file correctly.
If you have questions or bug feedback during configuration or use, please contact QQ 1207223090 for help.

It should be noted that the first time the plugin is put into the server, it may restart your server once.
This is not a plug-in that causes the server to crash. Instead, the plug-in restarts to apply the saved value of the plug-in.

I wish you a happy time~

1. Prepare the server
This plug-in is different from other plug-ins, this plug-in will automatically match the server code to generate the configuration.
Don't worry about garbled issues, your editors also follow the rules for configuring encoding.
In order to achieve automatic restart of the server, set up an automatic restart script for your server.
If your server is a web page panel manipulation server, there is no need to worry about this.
If your server is a VPS, add a self-restart script to the startup server script.
If you don't add a self-restart script, please refer to the post: XXXXXXXXXX
