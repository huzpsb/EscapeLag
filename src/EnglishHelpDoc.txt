Welcome to the configuration guide!
First of all, thank you for using the EscapeLag plugin.
The plug-in is a technical optimization plug-in optimized by integrating, repairing vulnerabilities, restricting actions, and high algorithmic efficiency.
Consult this guide to configure your Config.yml file correctly,
If you have questions or Bug feedback in configuration or use, please contact QQ 1207223090 to get help.
It's important to note that the plug in of the server for the first time may restart your server once,
This is not a plug-in that causes the server to crash, but rather a plug-in restart to apply the value saved by the plug-in.
Wish you have a good time ~!
1. prepare server
Unlike other plug-ins, this plug-in automatically matches server code to generate configuration.
No need to worry about garbled questions. Your editor also follows the configuration encoding rules.
In order to automatically restart the server, please set up the auto restart script for your server.
If your server is a web page panel manipulation server, you don't have to worry about that.
If your server is VPS, add the self restart script in the startup server script.
If you do not join the self restart script, please refer to the post: XXXXXXXXXX
Note: if you enter the message options "or" (blank but need to maintain, then quotes) means that you close this message.
